<p>Iâ€™m [username], Chemical Engineer learning programming and uploading whatever he manages to come up with here.
You, who probably know way more about programming than I do, are free too look -and despair- at my attempts to get a computer to do something simple. 
If you have any advice on how I could improve, please share!</p>
